There is a lot of necessary jargon to learn for coding. The goal of glossary is to provide a lightweight solution for making glossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown. This package provides functions to link terms in text to their definitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary table of all linked terms at the end of a section.

## Installation

You can (hopefully soon) install glossary from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("glossary")
```

You can install the development version of glossary from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("debruine/glossary")
```

## Example

Click on the terms to see a popup definition.

```{r, results='asis'}
library(glossary) 
glossary_path("inst/glossary.yml")
glossary_style("purple", "underline")
```

To calculate `r glossary("power")`, you need to know the intended sample size, expected `r glossary("effect size")` (e.g., `r glossary("SESOI")`), and `r glossary("alpha")` criterion.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
glossary_table()
```

See [getting started](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/articles/glossary.html) for more details.
